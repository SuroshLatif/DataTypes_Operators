#Stings and casting

- Indexing in python starts from 0 

- H e l l o   w o r l d   !
- 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

#Lets have a look at some string methods


# Concatination and Casting

- First_Name = "James"
- Last_Name = "Bond"
- age = "99" #int
- print(First_Name, Last_Name, str(age))
- print(type(int(age)))
