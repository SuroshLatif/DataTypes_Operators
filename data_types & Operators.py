# Lets see the data types in action

# a = 24
# b = 16
# c = 5.5 # float as decimal
#
# # Lets check the boolean values
# print(a > b)
# print(a < b)

# Lets look at some built in methods for boolean
# print(a + b)
# print(a - b)
# print(a * b)
# print(a / b)
# print(a + c)
#
# greetings = "Hello World!"
# # isalpha() helps us find if the variable holding letters
# print(greetings.isalpha())
#
# # islower () check if the statement in lower case
# print(greeting.islower())
#
# print(greetings.endswith("!"))
# print(greetings.startswith("H"))
# In SQL we have seen NULL but in python  we have none which is key word in python
